    "The goal of the project would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Write your own code (not an existing repo on the internet) that performs single shot ptychography using structured illumination as demonstrated in the papers by Levitan et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. What happens if the illumination (=probe) field has zero crossings? Is this a problem for the method? Do zero crossing result in non-measured points?\n",
    "\n",
    "b. suppose the method is simulated using 2x2 upsampling (that is, 2x2 probe pixels determine the average phase in a 1x1 super-pixel inside the object). Is it required that there is a relative phase shift between the 2x2 pixels inside the probe? Or can the modulation be amplitude-only (that is no phase shift, but an intensity variation)\n",
    "\n",
    "c. What is the minimum amount of upsampling needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Is there a class of illumination functions for which the method fails?\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Try implementing regularization to the method. Please include L1, L2, and Total variation regularization."
